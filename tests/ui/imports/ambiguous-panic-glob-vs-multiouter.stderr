   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #147319 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/147319>
   = note: ambiguous because of a conflict between a name from a glob import and an outer scope during import or macro resolution
note: `panic` could refer to the macro imported here

LL |     use m1::*;
   |         ^^^^^
